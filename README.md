# ACM Research coding challenge (Fall 2022)

# Libraries & Solution

Although I was not well-versed in Pandas, Numpy, & SkLearn, I was able to jump right into manipulating the data. I decided to use SkLearn for their linear regression modules. With that in mind, I wanted to predict the 'Value for the money' rating based off of the 'Reliability Rating' and the 'Seller Rating'

# Linear Regression
Unfortunately, when I was taking AP Stats in high school, the pandemic had hit the states so I never had a formal education on linear regression, but thankfully to the youtube links down below, I was able to code a multivariate regression for the dataset in order to create a line/plane of best fit

# Challenges
I found it a bit difficult to clean up the "Prices" column, but once I finally did, I realized that it was very skewed. With most prices being under 100k, there unfortunately some listings hitting even over 400k. If I had more time I could have definitely cleaned it up more and changed the scaling on the graph but in the end I decided to use "Value for the money" as I found it to be the 'next best thing' to replace the 'Price' category.

Moreover, I was unable to splice my graphs together. The first graph with the gradient is displaying the original data and that is perfectly fine. However. my original intention was to have the plane of best fit to be on the second graph with the 3D scatterplot and delete the 3rd graph (the 2D scatter plot with the line of best fit) entirely because of its redundancy. But I was inclined to keep all 3 graphs for their individual perspectives on the data given.

# Notes
I have also included a file which displays the plane of best fit that I was unable to add onto the 2nd graph
